# CSV-file-management
This is a program i made for my first year of IT college, its written in C and allows you to manage a csv file with a prompt menu





-- the present dataase.csv is an example file, if you wanna try. though you are free to use your own or directly create one via the program

!! USE THE RIGTH ORDER IN CSV FILE, OR MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES BEFORE USING... IT COULD RUIN A CSV FILE !!
